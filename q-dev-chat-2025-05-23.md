Looking at the Menu.jsx file, I can see that the image tag is incomplete. Let me fix this by completing the image tag and adding the rest of the component's return statement.

The issue is at the end of the file where the `<img src={selectedAd}` tag is not closed. I'll complete this tag and add the necessary closing tags for the component.

Here's what needs to be added:

```jsx
<img src={selectedAd} alt="Promotional Ad" className="w-full h-auto rounded-xl" />
                        </motion.div>
                    </motion.div>
                )}
            </AnimatePresence>

            {/* Main content */}
            <div className="container mx-auto px-4 py-8">
                {/* Banner Section */}
                <div className="relative w-full h-48 md:h-64 lg:h-80 mb-8 overflow-hidden rounded-2xl">
                    {bannerImages.map((banner, index) => (
                        <div
                            key={index}
                            className={`absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full transition-opacity duration-1000 ${
                                index === currentBanner ? 'opacity-100' : 'opacity-0'
                            }`}
                        >
                            <img src={banner} alt={`Banner ${index + 1}`} className="w-full h-full object-cover" />
                        </div>
                    ))}
                </div>

                {/* Menu Grid */}
                <div className={`grid ${columns} gap-6 transition-opacity duration-300 ${isCategoryChanging ? 'opacity-0' : 'opacity-100'}`}>
                    {menuItems
                        .filter(item => item.category === activeCategory)
                        .filter(item => searchQuery === '' || item.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()))
                        .map((item, index) => (
                            <div 
                                key={index} 
                                className="bg-white rounded-2xl shadow-md overflow-hidden hover:shadow-lg transition-shadow cursor-pointer"
                                onClick={() => setSelectedItem(item)}
                            >
                                <div className="relative h-48 overflow-hidden">
                                    <img
                                        src={images[item.imageKey] || 'placeholder.jpg'}
                                        alt={item.name}
                                        className="w-full h-full object-cover"
                                    />
                                </div>
                                <div className="p-4">
                                    <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mb-1">{item.name}</h3>
                                    <p className="text-primary font-medium">{item.price}</p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        ))}
                </div>
            </div>
            
            {/* Cart Bar */}
            <CartBar 
                setShowTotalSummary={setShowTotalSummary} 
                setSummaryAnim={setSummaryAnim}
            />
        </div>
    );
};

export default Menu;
```

This completes the Menu component with the minimal code needed to fix the issue. The main problems were:

1. The incomplete `<img>` tag
2. Missing closing tags for the motion.div elements
3. Missing main content section with the menu items
4. Missing CartBar component at the bottom

I need to fix the Menu component by completing the missing code. The issue is that the image tag is incomplete and the component is missing its closing tags.

Here's what needs to be fixed:

1. The `<img src={selectedAd}` tag needs to be closed properly
2. The component needs proper closing tags and structure

Since we're having issues with the file system tools, let me provide the complete code that you can manually copy and replace in your Menu.jsx file:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect, useMemo } from 'react';
// Replace missing ad images with placeholder images
import banner1 from '@assets/menu_assets/banner1.svg';
import banner2 from '@assets/menu_assets/banner2.svg';
import banner3 from '@assets/menu_assets/banner3.svg';
import images from "@utils/imageLoader";
import CartBar from "@features/client/menu/components/CartBar";
import { useClientContext } from "@context/ClientContext";
import Icon from "@components/common/Icon";
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const Menu = () => {
    const [openAds, setOpenAds] = useState(true);
    
    // Use banner images as placeholders for ads since the ad images don't exist
    const ads = [banner1, banner2, banner3, banner1];

    // Randomly pick one ad image once on mount
    const selectedAd = useMemo(() => {
        const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * ads.length);
        return ads[randomIndex];
    }, []);

    const [columns, setColumns] = useState('repeat(5, 1fr)');
    const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState('');
    const [searchInput, setSearchInput] = useState('');
    const [quantities, setQuantities] = useState({});
    const [selectedItem, setSelectedItem] = useState(null);
    const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('description');
    const [activeCategory, setActiveCategory] = useState('Classic Milktea Series');
    const [isCategoryChanging, setIsCategoryChanging] = useState(false);
    const [detailAnim, setDetailAnim] = useState(false);
    const bannerImages = [banner1, banner2, banner3];
    const [currentBanner, setCurrentBanner] = useState(0);
    const [showTotalSummary, setShowTotalSummary] = useState(false);
    const [summ

- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints organized by resource

### Key Features to Implement

1. **Product Management**
   - Complete CRUD operations for menu items
   - Image upload and management
   - Category organization

2. **Cart System**
   - Persistent cart using localStorage or database
   - Product customization (size, sugar level, ice level, add-ons)
   - Quantity management

3. **Order Processing**
   - Order creation and tracking
   - Pickup time selection
   - Payment integration (GCash)

4. **User Authentication**
   - Sign up/Sign in
   - User profile management
   - Order history

5. **Admin Dashboard**
   - Sales analytics
   - Order management
   - Product inventory control
   - User management

## Development Priorities

1. **Complete the Menu Page**
   - Fix the search functionality
   - Implement category filtering
   - Complete the product detail modal
   - Finalize cart functionality

2. **Order Processing Flow**
   - Connect cart to checkout
   - Implement payment selection
   - Add pickup time selection
   - Order confirmation

3. **Backend Integration**
   - Replace placeholder data with API calls
   - Implement proper error handling
   - Add loading states

4. **User Authentication**
   - Complete sign-in/sign-up flow
   - Add profile management
   - Implement order history

5. **Testing and Optimization**
   - Cross-browser testing
   - Mobile responsiveness
   - Performance optimization

## Technical Debt to Address

1. Replace hardcoded menu items with data from API
2. Implement proper form validation
3. Add error boundaries for component failures
4. Optimize image loading with lazy loading
5. Add proper TypeScript typing (if using TypeScript)
6. Implement comprehensive testing

This structure will provide a solid foundation for completing your Hamutea website while allowing for the flexibility to make major revisions as needed.
